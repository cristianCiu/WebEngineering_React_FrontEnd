This is the Frontend for the WebEngineering group project at the FH Campus Wien.

### Backend:

> https://github.com/JamHaven/CoronaMiddleware

## Techstack:

- **[depcheck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depcheck)** to track react npm dependencies
- **[plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/react)** also for advanced charts
- **[apollo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/client)** as a GraphQL client
- **[bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** for style elements

## Notes:

- Since introducing Plotly the React App needs more space, so an memory error occured. For that, the start script was adapted with the parameter **--max_old_space_size=4096**, which was added to **start** and **build** script in _package.json_.

## Guide

> npm install

> npm start
