## Techstack:

- **depcheck** to track react npm dependencies
- **chart.js** to display react charts
- **react-chartjs-2** as a wrapper for chart.js
- **graphql2chartjs** to form GraphQL data into chartJS
- **apollo** as a GraphQL client

## Notes:

Important dependency lock: **"core-js": "^2.6.5"**. Else, there is the error _"Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'core-js/modules/web.dom.iterable'"_
